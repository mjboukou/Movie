# Movie_Library

I have developed a Java project for Univercity called Movie Library back in 2017.
It was an exercise for the course "Software Development".

The program has been designed to be user-friendly, with an intuitive interface that allows users to easily use the 
search function that enables users to find movies based on specific criteria such as the movie title, director, or genre.
